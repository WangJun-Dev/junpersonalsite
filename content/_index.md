Hello, traveller from afar who has wandered into this little patch of land on the internet. Be your visit by chance or by intent, welcome. May you find what you seek, or perhaps discover something delightful.

I'm Xiang Fu, currently a Data Science and Computer Science student in the [Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences (CDS)](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/) at [[BU Wiki|Boston University]], taking [[BU Course Wiki|these courses]]. Most recently, I've been working with the wonderful [Najoung Kim](https://najoung.kim), and equally wonderful [Catherine Caldwell-Harris](https://www.bu.edu/psych/charris/).

Should you choose to explore further, you might start with some [[Projects|projects]], [photos](https://snap.fufoundation.co), or [[Ideas|ideas]]. For those who enjoy playing around with maps, scroll down and one shall be revealed.

You can also try to visit [[Planet 404|Planet 404]] if you find yourself absolutely bored. There's also my [[CV|CV]], [[Schedule|schedule]], or [[Public Key|Public Key]] in case you're looking for any of those.
