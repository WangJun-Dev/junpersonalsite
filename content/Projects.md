A collection of my projects and experiments. Some of these are documented in my [blog posts], and many started as [[ideas]].

## Learning from Verbal Rules vs. Data [2025 - Present]

We investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of Large Language Models in learning new systems through two distinct approaches: verbal rule descriptions and data examples. We explore whether LLMs exhibit different learning patterns and performance when presented with explicit rules versus learning from exemplar data.

## Decentralized Neural Traffic Orchestration [2024]

We present DNC, a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for traffic signal optimization that introduces two key innovations: an Integrated Deep Q-Network (DQN) combining hierarchical learning, shared experience, and state-sharing mechanisms, and a novel Communication-Aware State Fusion (CASF) method that uses attention mechanisms to dynamically weight state information based on neighborhood topology. Final project for Fall 2024's [DS 340 Introduction to Machine Learning and AI](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cds/courses/cds-ds-340/).

## KITE: Kernel-based Inference of Trait Epistasis [2024]

KITE is a Python package for detecting epistatic interactions in quantitative trait loci (QTL) data using kernel-based methods. Final project for Spring 2024's [DS 596 Foundations of Biological Data Science](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cds/courses/cds-ds-596/).

## CoPDA [2024]

A large-scale analytics system for computational policy document analysis of Chinese Government Policy Documents.

## GomokuPro [2022]

A novel algorithm leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Monte Carlo tree search. We aim to address the long computation times faced by traditional algorithms in board games. By transforming a multidimensional fractional model into an adaptive model, we built upon a previously developed single-strategy machine learning framework capable of making judgments and predictions using human-like decision algorithms.
